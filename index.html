<h1>     Solar System    </h1>
<h2>Mercury  </h2>

<p>   It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn't have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple. Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time.</p>

<h2>  Venus   </h2>

<p>  Venus is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and it has clouds of sulfuric acid. </p>

<h2> Earth </h2>

<p> Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. </p>

<h2>   Mars </h2>

<p> ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. </p>
<br> <BR>
<h2> Jupiter </h2>
<img src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/7/Jupiter-PNG-Picture.png" width="350">
<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. </p>
<br> <BR>
<h2>  Neptune</h2>
<img src="https://clipground.com/images/neptune-png-1.png" width="350px">
<p>It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. </p>

<h2> Saturn  </h2>

<p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has dozens of moons. </p>

<h2> Uranus </h2>

<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. </p>
